Follow these steps to install Anaconda and set up your Python environment.
Download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

### Create and activate environment, install jupyterlab

Create a new environment (replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and choose your preferred Python version):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/handichan/data_structures_and_algorithms.git

conda create --name myenv python=3.12
conda activate myenv
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
jupyter lab
